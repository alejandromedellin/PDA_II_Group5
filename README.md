# Trading System Web Application

Welcome to our Trading System Web Application! This project combines an ETL process, a machine learning model, a Python API wrapper for SimFin, and a Streamlit-based web interface to deliver real-time stock data, financial statements, trading signals, and a backtesting simulator.

## Overview

This application provides:
1. **Share Prices:** Fetch daily share price data for selected tickers.
2. **Financial Statements:** Retrieve quarterly or annual statements from SimFin.
3. **ML Model Predictions:** Predict next-day price movements (BUY, SELL, HOLD).
4. **Trading Strategy & Signals:** Suggest actions based on model output.
5. **Optional Backtesting:** Simulate how a strategy would have performed historically.

The system uses an ETL script to clean and prepare data, an XGBoost-based machine learning model to predict stock movements, and a Streamlit multipage interface for user interaction.

- **`app.py`**: Launches the Streamlit app.
- **`pages/`**: Contains multipage files for the app (Home, Go Live, Backtesting, etc.).
- **`ETL.py`**: Cleans and processes raw CSV data into training/test sets.
- **`ML_MODEL.py`**: Trains the XGBoost model and provides a prediction function.
- **`pysimfin.py`**: Python wrapper for the SimFin API.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   cd <your-repo>
   
2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Obtain CSV Files

For this application to work, it is key that the end user downloads the following .csv files from SimFin:

us-income-quarterly
us-shareprices-daily
us-companies
Place these files in the same directory as ETL.py (or adjust paths in ETL.py accordingly).

4. Run ETL

python ETL.py

5. Train the ML Model

python ML_MODEL.py

Required CSV Files
us-income-quarterly.csv
Quarterly income statement data from SimFin.

us-shareprices-daily.csv
Daily share price data for U.S. stocks from SimFin.

us-companies.csv
Company metadata (tickers, industries, etc.) from SimFin.

Make sure these files are in the correct folder (the same folder as ETL.py by default), or modify the file paths in ETL.py if needed.

Usage
Once you have run the ETL and trained the model:

streamlit run app.py

This command will:

Launch the Streamlit application in your browser.
Provide multipage navigation (Home, Go Live, optional Backtesting, etc.).
Let you select tickers, date ranges, and view predictions/trading signals.

Features
Price Data: View share prices for a selected ticker and date range, plus a line chart of closing prices.
Financial Statements: Fetch the most recent or selected period’s statements (Income, Balance, Cash Flow, Derived).
Trading Signals: Next-day BUY/SELL/HOLD predictions, displayed in a visually appealing format.
Optional Backtesting: Evaluate a trading strategy historically to see how it would have performed.
